## Mission and Scope

The Outreach Committee is responsible for the design, development and execution of community outreach efforts on behalf of the Governing Board.

The Outreach Committee will include one appointed voting representative from each Premier Member. Each General Member may appoint a non-voting representative to observe and contribute ideas to the Outreach Committee. The current Outreach Committee consists of the representatives listed on this page: [Outreach Committee](https://cd.foundation/about/outreach-committee/)
