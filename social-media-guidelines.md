# CDF Social Media Guidelines

This document covers the social media guidelines for the use of the CDF Twitter [@CDeliveryFdn](https://twitter.com/CDeliveryFdn) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/19100461/admin/).

## Target Audience

The CDF’s social media channels are for everyone wanting to be part of the Continuous Delivery, open source, and DevOps community.

## Objectives

The objectives of CDF social media:

* Advance topics and conversations that are relevant to and beneficial for the continuous delivery and DevOps community, with a particular focus on open source and best practices. 
* Continue building positive affinity for CDF projects among key influencers and throughout the continuous delivery community
    * Drive engagement and participation in CDF projects
    * Share CDF project news, roadmap updates, news releases
    * Report on performance and security updates
    * Educate on project updates
    * Share information on how-tos, demos, etc. that are valuable to the community
    * Build awareness for the project and the Continuous Delivery community
    * Drive engagement and participation in the Continuous Delivery community and events.

## Themes and Topics

Informational, engaging, and ecosystem-focused content:

* CDF projects
* CDF end-user community
* Contributor/SIG blog posts
* Continuous delivery ecosystem
* CDF event information and deadlines (i.e. CFP, Registration)
* Technical topics such as DevOps, GitOps, Continuous Delivery, etc.
* Industry vertical topics such as FinTech, DevSecOps, etc.
* Informational: Tutorials, editorials, news stories. Items that help connect the dots for our community
* Thought leadership: insights, perspectives, learnings, and experiences

## Strategy

* Keep messages positive and uplifting, consistent with the [values and principles of CDF](https://github.com/cdfoundation/charter/blob/master/CHARTER.md).
* Share content across social media channels that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.
* Communicate big picture ideas vs “announcements” or news. News will be positioned less like an announcement and more around what it means.
* Ecosystem content is vendor-neutral and project-impartial sourced from contributors, maintainers, ambassadors, news outlets, etc., including blog posts, news coverage, thought leadership bylines, technology demos, sketch notes, GitHub work, continuous delivery-specific Meetups, etc.
* Maintain a balance of posting on CDF activities/news and ecosystem-focused content.
* Engage with the continuous delivery end-user and open-source community individuals through retweets and sharing of community content.
* Post vendor-neutral, community-sourced content that is informational, engaging, and ecosystem-focused.
* CDF is not able to share anything on our channels that promotes a vendor product or directs to a company website.
* Keep a vendor-neutral space, which means social posts from member company handles and/or vendor channels cannot be shared or reposted.
* Community content that abides by the channel guidelines and includes insight from/work with more than one CDF project will be prioritized for sharing.
* Activities that are hosted by and open to the public can be promoted, as they benefit the ecosystem as a whole.
* Promote diversity and inclusion through our channels.

## General Guidelines

For all CDF social activity, we remain a neutral foundation. Examples of the type of content:

* Content produced by the CDF: news, events, blogs, case studies, survey data, etc.
* Project content is anything sourced from [CDF’s currently hosted projects](https://cd.foundation/projects/), including project news, roadmap updates, new releases, performance/security updates, blogs, conferences slides/videos, etc.
* Ecosystem content is vendor-neutral and project-impartial sourced from contributors, maintainers, ambassadors, news outlets, etc., including blog posts, news coverage, non-CDF open source projects, thought leadership bylines, technology demos, sketch notes, GitHub work, continuous delivery-specific Meetups, etc.
* CDF is not able to share anything on our channels that promotes a vendor product or directs to a company website.
* Social posts from member company handles and/or vendor channels cannot be shared.
* Retweets are limited to @linuxfoundation (and related tweets from umbrella organizations) news outlet handles, non-profit organizations, project handles, and personal handles.
* Community content that abides by the channel guidelines + includes insight from/work with more than one CDF project will be prioritized for sharing.
* Activities that are hosted by and open to the public can be promoted, as they benefit the ecosystem as a whole.

## Images & Videos

Images shared, unless specifically credited back to a community member, will meet the requirements of “free for commercial use” and “no attribution required.”


## Hashtags

CDF uses hashtags in our posts:

* To measure the success of campaigns (for example, #cdCon);
* To expand our reach beyond our current followers and tap into larger, trending topics on Twitter (for example, #GitOps, #DevOps)
* To organize or categorize shares (for example, #Jenkins).

## To request content to be shared

Share your content and social posts on the [#content](https://cdeliveryfdn.slack.com/archives/C017AV8030C) channel on the CDF Slack channel or email social@cd.foundation.
