# CD Foundation Stakeholder Personas

The following personas have influence over processes and decisions that the CD Foundation seeks to innovate and govern. These individuals participate in the community flywheel of open source software awareness, adoption, and advocacy. On some level, they all make decisions about using software to advance organizational goals. This makes them ideal target audiences for CDF content and programs. CD Foundation content and programs should identify a primary audience for each offering, and any secondary audiences.



## Application Developer

I develop web, mobile, and business applications for my organization. I am usually an individual contributor (IC) on a team. I use SDLC tooling as a means to an end and usually have some freedom to choose tools and environments. I may have strong opinions about enablers and constraints to my success as a developer, such as standard toolchains workflows at my organization, personal DevOps habits, and team behaviors. 

#### Content & Programs that appeal to me:

- Meetups
- "Solving" solution-specific blog post
- Stackoverflow answers
- How-to / educational content

Example title: How to Bake & Deploy Your App to EC2 

#### Key Pain Points:
- Context switching
- Observability of status & processes after code check-in
- Potentially limited coding experience and needs GUI-based tools
- Monolith-breaking is hard

## DevOps Specialist/Cloud Engineer

I enable application teams to build software, and often build and maintain software and systems to enable them. I have firsthand knowledge of the way software is being developed and delivered at my organization. I must think about our SDLC from a macro perspective to make good decisions about tools and projects to invest team time and money in. Automation appeals to me because I often focus on scalability, repeatability, and productivity in my solutions.

- How can I support various workload types or application targets - cloud, on prem, blah! Lots - heterogeneity
- How to select the correct tools? Are part of selecting tooling for the organization - OSS vs. vendor - hard to make decisions with a complicated integration matrix
- Managing integrations becomes complicated
- Hard to get consumers like app dev to adopt new tools (people are set in their ways, plus legacy workloads, costs)
- Educating and onboarding new users is a big challenge and doesnâ€™t guarantee successful adoption


## Delivery Director

I direct my organization tactically to maximize return on our investment in software and information systems. I often manage DevOps Champion individual contributors (ICs) and guide them to drive agility and systemic improvement. I optimize our ability to meet business, customer, product, and engineering needs by delivering reliable infrastructure, processes, and tooling to support complex systems. I trust my engineers to recommend the right tools for our workflows.

## Technology Executive

I offer executive guidance on the alignment of technical resources to our organizational needs.

## Developer Advocate

I research and develop hands-on projects and solutions using open source tools as part of my developer relations or advocacy role. While building solutions, I develop a deep understanding of the pros and cons of different tools/platforms. I have a strong connection to the technical implementation and business application of the projects because of my work with stakeholders from different companies, and make solution recommendations to my customers. I have awareness of many projects and may contribute and engage heavily in those I'm passionate about, but I also need to maintain a broad knee-deep familiarity with a variety of tools and platforms.
